## About this repository

The data directory contains quite a few large files, so be sure to use a stable connection when checking out the entire repository.

There are four new datasets containing similarity cores between images in the Dresden image database. These sets are named after one of the cameras in 
their respective datasets: pentax, praktica, canon, olympus, and fuji.

To check out the canon, olympus and fuji sets you may need to first install git large file storage, see [git lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/). Also you will need bzip2 
to unpack the files.
