The jupyter noteboooks Paper_Clustering_xxxxx.ipynb contain the results presented in the paper "Clustering image noise patterns by Embedding and Visualization for Common Source Camera Detection" for every dataset.
Every notebook reads the appropriate coordinates file from data/embedded/coordinates_files/ and performs clustering on the embedded data. The benchmarking results are also calculated and a json file for [DiVE](https://sherlock-clustering.github.io/Sherlock_DiVE/), that contains the cluster labels, is generated. Please use the *coloring by property* section from the DiVE user interface to color by cluster label.
