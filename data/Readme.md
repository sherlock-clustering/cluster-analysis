This folder contains datasets for image forensics.
The folders canon, olympus, fuji, pentax and praktica each contain a filelist (list of names of all images from the corresponding dataset) and 
an edgelist (list of pairwise PCE similarity scores of the images of the corresponding dataset).
The edgelist is used as an input to the LargeVis application from  https://github.com/lferry007/LargeVis 
The filelist is used to extract the image name and the source camera for benchmarking the clustering.
